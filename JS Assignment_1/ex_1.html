        <hr>
        <p>
            <b>What will the code below output to the console and why ?</b>
            <code>
                </code></p><pre><code>                    console.log(1 + "2" + "2");
                    console.log(1 + + "2" + "2");
                    console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");
                    console.log(+ "1" + "1" + "2");
                    console.log("A" - "B" + "2");
                    console.log("A" - "B" + 2);
                </code></pre><code>
            </code>

            <b><u>OUTPUT</u></b><br>
            <pre>                console.log(1 + "2" + "2"); 
                &gt;&gt;&gt; 122
                    Here 1 2 2 were considered as a string so it just concats all and prints as 122.
            
                console.log(1 + + "2" + "2");
                &gt;&gt;&gt; 32
                    Here 1 + +"2" is considered as a arithmetic addition so it gives 3 and this 3 concats with "2" to give 32.
                    single + means concat, double + means for addition operation.
                
                console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");
                &gt;&gt;&gt; 02
                    Same above with subtract operation so 1 - 1 gives 0 and this 0 concats with "2" to give 02.

                console.log(+ "1" + "1" + "2");
                &gt;&gt;&gt; 112
                    Here all were considerd as string only so it concats everything and gives 112.
                    The + sign before the first "1" is just dummy or it won't affect the output.

                console.log("A" - "B" + "2");
                &gt;&gt;&gt; NaN2
                    Here A and B are strings, with strings we can't do arithmetic operations and it is semantic(meaningless) error so it gives "NaN"
                    and this "NaN" again concats with the "2" to give NaN2.
        
                console.log("A" - "B" + 2)
                &gt;&gt;&gt; NaN
                    Here also as above A - B gives "NaN" and with this string we can only concat the values again performing addition is meaningless,
                    so it again gives "NaN".
